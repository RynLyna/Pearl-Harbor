**__This is what the bot will do:__**

For all arbiter's set quest boat:
- it will do as usual but will rely on player's choice, the items won't be unbanked and looted if players don't choose that item in their "choice".


For Sanctified Light of Destiny boat:

This bot will do The quest "A Newwer, Shinier Axe" (+ Ascended Light of Destiny quest version).
This quest will auto unbank necessary items in order to do the quests (You don't need to unbank yourself, this bot will do from A-Z for you :D)
Player will teleport to yulgar and the message (client message so it's safe) will appear to tell player about their progress status (E.g. Quest hasn't been unlocked because player didn't have BLoD, Daily quest has completed for today, launch this bot tmr, etc...); also 10 times Beep sound provided so notify player when the bot is completed/cannot run xD.
	For Loyal Spirit Orb checking, this bot will perform these tasks as below:
		Checking if player has Blinding Blade of Destiny inside their bank/inv, if not, it will unbank Blinding Daggers of Destiny, in the opposite if player really has Blinding Blade of Destiny, this bot will proceed on accepting "Finding Fragments with Blinding Blade" and keep grinding until u have enough Loyal Spirit Orb quantity as required. This check method will apply the same structure for Blinding Daggers of Destiny and the same for others.
	In summary, this is how the bot check system will perform what quest it will decide to do to get Loyal Spirit Orb in the most effective & fastest way (Best<----Worst).
		Finding Fragments with Blinding Blade (Best one) <---- Finding Fragments with Blinding Daggers <---- Finding Fragments with Blinding Scythe <---- Merging Spirit Orbs <---- Ultimate Weapon Kit Construction (worst case).
	Same structure for checking Bright Aura:
	Finding Fragments with Blinding Bow (Best one) <---- Finding Fragments with Blinding Broadsword <---- Finding Fragments with Blinding Scythe <---- Ultimate Weapon Kit Construction (worst case.).
	Same for checking Spirit Orbs:
		Finding Fragments with Blinding Broadsword (Best one) <---- Finding Fragments with Blinding Blade <---- Essential Essences (will skip if you don't have enough 125 Undead Essences for 5 SO) <---- Ultimate Weapon Kit Construction (worst case).
	(Like as I said above, these items are all auto unbanked so you don't need to worry about what items need to be unbanked before starting this bot. The only thing u need to worry is your inventory space as I included in the requirements section.).
If player didn't have these 2 items as requirements for SLoD quest: "Glorious Gold of Destiny", and "Pious Platinum of Destiny", the quest will start checking what needs to have these two and so on (doing Enchantment quest, auto merge, etc.)
In the worst case, if player doesn't have Gold or Platinum, the quest will auto accept and grind Mine Crafting quest, since it's a daily quest, this bot will detect and tp you to yulgar and a message will appear to tell player to run this bot for tmr since it's a daily quest and u need Gold and Platinum for your main quest (THIS MC QUEST WILL ONLY LOOT GOLD AND PLATINUM ONLY SO IT'S NOT A GOOD REPLACEMENT TO GRIND FULL STACK OF ITEMS IN MC QUEST.)
