Only usable with _pro bots.

This is a placeholder list of instructions until I make a clear video guide for this. Ping Bluu#1913 on the
/r/AutoQuestWorlds discord server (invite link: https://discord.gg/p7Q7PY2Ytk) if you need further assistance.
[Video guide will be in this week or the next, as of me uploading this to the website].

There are 3 main types of skillsets: Soloing, Farming, and Full Dodge. Soloing is used for killing a single strong
monster, Farming for killing multiple monsters, and Full Dodge for killing a single extremely strong monster.

Note: EVEN IF A CLASS USES THE SAME SKILLSET FOR SOLOING AND FARMING, PLEASE USE ITS SOLOING SKILLSET FOR SOLOING
AND ITS FARMING SKILLSET FOR FARMING. THEY ARE DESIGNED DIFFERENTLY TO FIT THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES AND NOT USING THE
RIGHT SKILLSET WILL CAUSE ISSUES.

1) Open the bot you want to edit in Grimoire. See what skillsets are required by the bot, for example, Soloing,
   Farming, etc. 
2) Open an additional tab of Grimoire. (Right Click the Grimoire Icon on your taskbar and click Grimoire.)
3) Open the Bluu_GrimPro_Skillsets.gbot file in this new Grimoire.
4) Find a skillset for the class you want to use and copy it by left-clicking and dragging your mouse over the
   commands and using Ctrl+C. Certain bots allow you to use different skillsets for High HP or Low HP Farming,
   in such cases just use your generic farming class' skillset unless the one you're using has different skillsets
   for them (VampLord, Dragon of Time, and DragonLord have different skillsets for them). Same applies with Low HP,
   High HP, and Defensive Soloing.
5) Now go back to the first tab of Grimoire you opened and paste it into the appropriate section. Repeat this for
   all the skillsets.
