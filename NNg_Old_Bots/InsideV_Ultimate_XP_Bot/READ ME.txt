ULTIMATE XP / GOLD / CLASS BOT

IMPORTANT INFO: If you are lower than 75, the bot will send you to the 'Less than 75'label which has the aggromon healer packet.
Once you hit lvl 75, the bot will send you to the 'level 75+' label and lvl you up to lvl 100. Once lvl 100 you can either turn the bot off or level up classes or grind for gold.

The bot also has an unbank section for Treasure Chest item (For Drakath Armor quest), it will automatically send treasure chest from bank to inventory if Treasure chest isn't already  
in inventory. (Will auto pick up treasure chests until max)

CHANGING SETS / CLASS: If you want you can add in your own weapon / armour / helmet / cape / class.

SKILLSET: You do not need to change the skillset for each class you want to equip. It is set to a common skillset rotation set for all classes / you will be in a public room so don't 
worry about dying :).
